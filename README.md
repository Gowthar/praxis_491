# praxis_491

This is a series of problems given on (https://programmingpraxis.com/contents/chron/).
Purpose: Build Portfolio
Purpose: Practice coding style / interview style problems
Purpose: Gain mastery over python

What this code WILL NOT focus on
1. Security and indepth sanitization of input: I am not looking to make this public user friendly just scientist level friendly.
2. Code speed performance: This is meant primarly for problem solving in slick ways not meant for GPU, multi-threading etc, another day.
